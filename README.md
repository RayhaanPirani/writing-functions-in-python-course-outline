   * Lesson 1.3 - Passing values to and receiving values from functions
     * Description: Learn how to send and receive data to and from a function.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to send values to be used inside a function and receive return values back from a function.
## Chapter 2 - Arguments and scope
   * Lesson 2.1 - Introduction to scope and blocks
     * Description: See how scope and blocks work and how variables are valid within their scope.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to use variable scope and blocks effectively.
   * Lesson 2.2 - Using default values for optional arguments
     * Description: Students will be able to create default values for optional arguments.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to use some pre-defined values when the argument is not specified.
   * Lesson 2.3 - Order of arguments and using arguments by name
     * Description: Understand the concept of the order of arguments and learn how to use named arguments.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to order arguments effectively and make proper use of named arguments.
   * Lesson 2.4 - Functions, arguments, and scope exercise
     * Description: Exercise to consolidate previously learned topics.
     * A learning objective: Learners will put learned concepts of creating functions, scopes, blocks, and arguments to test.
## Chapter 3 - Functions and objects
   * Lesson 3.1 - Basics of classes and objects
     * Description: Learn the ideas of classes and objects.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to create and use classes and create objects from classes.
   * Lesson 3.2 - Introduction to methods
     * Description: Understand methods and their association to a class.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to create functions that belong to a class.
   * Lesson 3.3 - Functions act as first-class objects
     * Description: Study how functions can themselves be used as objects.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be more confident in dealing with functions as objects and create better code as a result.
   * Lesson 3.4 - Functions in an object-oriented context exercise
     * Description: Exercise to consolidate previously learned topics.
     * A learning objective: Learners will utilize learned concepts to build their own class from scratch.
## Chapter 4 - Advanced function concepts
   * Lesson 4.1 - Introduction to lambda functions
     * Description: Understand what are lambda function, their syntax, and how they can be useful.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to develop quick in-line functions using lambda functions.
   * Lesson 4.2 - Understanding iterables and iterators
     * Description: Learn about iterables and iterators and build your own.
     * A learning objective: Students will be able to create their own iterators.
   * Lesson 4.3 - Defining generators
     * Description: Study generators and how they work, their usefulness, and create your own.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to define an infinite series of values using generators and develop their own.
   * Lesson 4.4 - Using decorators
     * Description: Understand and build decorators, their usefulness, and how to develop your own ones.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to extend the behavior of existing functions without modifying them by using decorators.
   * Lesson 4.5 - Advanced function concepts exercise
     * Description: Exercise to consolidate previously learned topics.
     * A learning objective: Learners will enhance the class built in the previous chapter using advanced concepts of lambda functions, iterators, generators, and decorators.
