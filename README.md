## Chapter 1 - Introduction to Python functions
   * Lesson 1.1 - Python function basics
     * Description: Understand the basics of functions in Python, why they are useful, and how to call pre-existing functions.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to appreciate the usefulness of Python functions and call pre-existing Python functions.
   * Lesson 1.2 - Defining own functions
     * Description: Learn the syntax for defining 
     function.
     * A learning objective: Students will be able to create their own Python function.
   * Lesson 1.3 - Passing values to and receiving values from functions
     * Description: Learn how to send and receive data to and from a function.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to send values to be used inside a function and receive return values back from a function.
## Chapter 2 - Arguments and scope
   * Lesson 2.1 - Introduction to scope and blocks
     * Description: See how scope and blocks work and how variables are valid within their scope.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to use variable scope and blocks effectively.
   * Lesson 2.2 - Using default values for optional arguments
     * Description: Students will be able to create default values for optional arguments.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to use some pre-defined values when the argument is not specified.
   * Lesson 2.3 - Order of arguments and using arguments by name
     * Description: Understand the concept of the order of arguments and learn how to use named arguments.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to order arguments effectively and make proper use of named arguments.
   * Lesson 2.4 - Functions, arguments, and scope exercise
     * Description: Exercise to consolidate previously learned topics.
     * A learning objective: Learners will put learned concepts of creating functions, scopes, blocks, and arguments to test.
## Chapter 3 - Functions and objects
   * Lesson 3.1 - Basics of classes and objects
     * Description: Learn the ideas of classes and objects.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to create and use classes and create objects from classes.
   * Lesson 3.2 - Introduction to methods
     * Description: Understand methods and their association to a class.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to create functions that belong to a class.
   * Lesson 3.3 - Functions as objects and objects as functions
     * Description: Study how functions can themselves be used as objects, and how objects can be made callable.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be more confident in dealing with functions as objects, and callable objects and create better code as a result.
   * Lesson 3.4 - Functions in an object-oriented context exercise
     * Description: Exercise to consolidate previously learned topics.
     * A learning objective: Learners will utilize learned concepts to build their own class from scratch.
## Chapter 4 - Advanced function concepts
   * Lesson 4.1 - Recursive functions
     * Description: Understand what recursive functions are, and how they work.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to develop their own recursive functions and understand code that uses recursion.
   * Lesson 4.2 - Defining nested functions
     * Description: Learn how functions can be defined within other functions, and how they can be useful in simplifying complicated function definitions.
     * A learning objective: Students will be able to create their own nested functions.
   * Lesson 4.3 - Dealing with mutable and immutable arguments
     * Description: Study how functions modify mutable and immutable arguments passed to functions.
     * A learning objective: Learners will be able to work with various types of parameters passed to functions and be aware of side-effects potentially caused by functions when passing mutable arguments.
   * Lesson 4.4 - Closures
     * Description: Understand the concept of function closures that remember the state of their parent function.
     * A learning objective: Students will be able to create their own Python closures.
   * Lesson 4.5 - Advanced function concepts exercise
     * Description: Exercise to consolidate previously learned topics.
     * A learning objective: Learners will enhance the class built in the previous chapter using advanced concepts of recursion, nested functions, and dealing with mutable and immutable arguments.
